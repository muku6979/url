CodeClause_URL-shortener- URL Shortener is a Python application that shortens long URLs into shorter ones that are easier to share on social media, messaging platforms, and other online platforms. This project uses the hashlib and string libraries to generate unique short URLs based on the MD5 hash of the long URL.

Installation Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener.git Change directory to the project root directory: cd url-shortener

Usage To use the application, import the url_shortener function from app.py:

from app import url_shortener

long_url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuG7ge_8I2Y&list=RDVuG7ge_8I2Y&start_radio=1

short_url = url_shortener(long_url)

print(short_url)

This will print a shortened URL based on the MD5 hash of the long URL.

Here is a basic algorithm for a URL shortener using the hashlib and string libraries in Python: Accept the long URL as input from the user. Generate an MD5 hash of the long URL using the hashlib library. Convert the MD5 hash to a string using the hexdigest() method. Select a substring of the hash string as the short URL. This can be done by taking a slice of the first N characters of the hash string, where N is the desired length of the short URL. Optionally, add a prefix to the short URL to distinguish it from other short URLs generated by the same application. Return the short URL to the user.
